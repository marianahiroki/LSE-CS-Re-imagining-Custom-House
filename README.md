# LSE-CS-Re-imagining-Custom-House
Proposing a restorative approach for Custom House, addressing local challenges amidst urban development and advocating for community-centered solutions.
This is a City Design Research Studio group project for LSE's MSC City Design and Social Science, 2022 was key to start my genuine interest in socio-spatial analysis.
This work and report is fully available at: https://csar.lse.ac.uk/articles/33

## Introduction/Context: ##

- The project's theme focused on Ecological Justice within the Newham Borough.
- The group selected Custom House as the site of interest, conducting academic research and ethnography to understand cities in their social, cultural, political, and spatial context.
- **Historical Context of Custom House:** Originating from industrial and residential expansions linked to Royal Victoria Docks, Custom House faced post-war challenges leading to poverty and deprivation, notably marked by the development of council estates.
- **Delayed Regeneration Impact:** Despite existing regeneration plans for Custom House, initiated by the Newham Council and private entities, a prolonged delay of two decades has led to closures of local businesses due to rising rents and impending demolition, impacting the area's social and economic landscape.
  
## Objectives: ##

- **Socio-Spatial Analysis:** Emphasis on diverse methods for understanding sites, exploring procedural and formal intervention possibilities, encompassing spatial design models, city-making practices, and public/private actions.
- **Addressing Social Challenges:** Exploring urban development approaches that tackle gender, ethnic diversity, and inequality issues, considering varied perspectives on city development.
- **Intervention Strategies:** Strategies for intervention, delving into detailed approaches to address socio-spatial challenges identified earlier, aiming for more nuanced and comprehensive solutions.
- **Comprehensive Approach to Urban Development:** Engaging with multifaceted aspects of city-making, from analysis to intervention, incorporating a wide array of approaches to ensure a holistic response to urban complexities.

## Data Collection and Analysis: ##

- Data sources included archives, interviews, and open data, mostly sourced from the London Data Store (see the list at the end of the page for more details).
- The following maps, produced with QGIS and numerous sources, aided in understanding the context of CH in its borough.

<sub>On the borough scale, a stark division between the Northern and Southern parts of Newham regarding High Street provision is evident. Custom House lacks an official High Street, having inaccessible commercial clusters often closed.</sub>

<sub>Instances of ecological severity occur in complex ways, directly affecting the health and well-being of Custom House residents. Life expectancy is notably impacted by air pollution, exacerbated by poor housing conditions and upcoming construction projects.</sub>

<sub>Custom House faces deep-rooted stigma stemming from its industrial past and subsequent socioeconomic challenges, causing varying social severities along race, gender, and class lines, reflected in income, employment, and crime rates. High population turnover in Newham hampers the formation of robust social bonds, despite the borough's diversity, highlighting the need for diverse spaces to foster connections and informal memberships for local residents. </sub>

<sub>Physical design improvements in neglected areas can trigger gentrification, increasing land values and inviting external investments, potentially displacing communities by replacing local businesses, raising rents, or erasing cultural symbols. This risk intensifies in places like Custom House, where a majority of residents are not homeowners, amplifying the threat of displacement due to urban interventions.</sub>

<sub>Most of the land in Custom House is publicly owned, which allows for greater flexibility and fewer opportunities for disputes between private landowners and the council. When examining currently under-utilized spaces, it becomes clear that the Freemason's High Street provides ample opportunity for an urban physical intervention that re-stitches Custom House to its greater borough.</sub>

## Key Learnings/Insights: ##

- **Community Deprivation in Custom House:** Custom House faces prolonged neglect, leading to declining living conditions, inadequate public spaces, heightened pollution levels, and social infrastructure decay, resulting in the lowest healthy life expectancy rates in London.

- **Restorative High Street Typology:** Proposing an alternative development approach, this work introduces the Restorative High Street Typology, aiming to mitigate urban severances by focusing on Freemasons Road and Prince Regent Lane as active community hubs, emphasizing retrofitting and refurbishing existing properties and implementing Affordable Community Infrastructure.

- **Sustainable Urban Intervention:** The typology challenges traditional regeneration models by emphasizing retrofitting, refurbishing, and constructing additional floors to increase density while advocating for policy interventions like emissions taxes on polluting industries and intermodality transport schemes, presenting a replicable programme for a healthier urban core.

## Impact/Results: ##

- **Holistic Approach to Sustainability:** : Emphasizing the critical role of the built environment in achieving environmental sustainability, advocating for a comprehensive understanding of physical, ecological, and social impacts on communities.
- **Restorative High Street Typology:** Proposing an alternative to conventional regeneration, aiming to break the liminal space by prioritizing repair and restoration, acknowledging urban complexity and diversity as opportunities for renewal.
- **Replicating the Typology:** Intending to apply the Restorative High Street Typology in marginalized areas through restoration that caters to current resident needs without compromising future ones, highlighting sustainability's multidimensional nature (ecological, economic, and social).
- **Inclusive Community Development:** Advocating for a more inclusive and community-based infrastructural development ethos, targeting and addressing the most burdensome issues irrespective of their origins or locations.

## Challenges and Solutions: ##

- Initial challenges in using QGIS were addressed through basic YouTube tutorials and native language resources.
- Overcoming feelings of data overload by trusting the process, validating data through interviews and cohesive analysis.
- Cleaning data: I did not know it was possible to filter data inside QGIS, instead I cleaned on Excel before and imported. Somehow, it was good to keep these spreadsheets available when needed and I think it is still valed.

## Future Steps/Recommendations: ##

- Investigate the impact of changing ward boundaries on data and perceptions.
- Study the health impact after the Silvertown Tunnel's opening and evaluate the effectiveness of emission taxes.
- Explore the role of new developments in building a better, safer community.
- Address contributions to residents by organizing workshops for transformative activities and collective mapping.
